Could you write a Java program that parse a text and output how many time each word occurs in a sentence. 

For example, the sentence : “this is a dog and this is a cat” should produce : 

This : 2

Is : 2

A : 2

Dog : 1

And : 1

Cat : 1

(the format in itself do not matter)

Additionally, can you sort the output by alphabetical order and reverse alphabetical order.
